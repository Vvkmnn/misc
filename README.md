Just some code/recipes I've randomly built or found. Feel free to take what you need, and leave what you like.

The code in here are designed for use in [Google Tag Manager](https://www.google.ca/analytics/tag-manager/), which I use often in my daily projects. It is significantly influenced by the amazing work of [Simo Ahava](http://www.simoahava.com/).
