Most of the functions used here as based on the functions illustrated in this work.\nIn order to analyze their behavior, we will create a fictional business known as 'Ties as a Service', and use it as a basis to generate values using those functions, in order to allow us to model the behavior of an example SaaS firm, and predict how these variables change over time.\n\n\n\\subsection*{Company Overview}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=3cm,keepaspectratio]{Tie.png}\n\n\\textbf{Ties as a Service}\n\\end{center}\n\n\n\"Ties as a Service\" is a fictional business that will be used to simulate the behavior of the 'Software as a Service' business model. It is similiar to the \"Jerky as a Service\" model by Noah Kagan\\footnote{http://www.appsumo.com/sumo-jerky/}, which was used as a basis to generate comparable numbers. \n\nThe business operates under the following assumptions:\n\n<<echo=F>>=\n\nSubscription <- 30 # Monthly subscription of $30 \nAvgDuration <- mean(1:2) # Average Contract Duration between 1 and 2 months \nDuration <- 1 # Typical contract duration\nARPA <- Subscription * AvgDuration # Average Monthly Recurring Revenue per Account\nMonths <- 12 # Months of simulation \nCustomers <- 60 # Initial influx of Customers (Month 1)\nMargin <- 0.45 # Average sale margin\nR <- 0.10 # Discount/Interest rate\nAdBudget <- 200 # Amount spent acquiring customers monthly\nMRR <- Subscription * Customers #Initial MRR\n\n@\n\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item For a monthly subscription of \\$$\\Sexpr{Subscription}$, the client recieves 2 ties per month. \n  \\item The user is initially offered a 1 or 2 month subscription, suggesting an average contract duration of $\\Sexpr{AvgDuration}$ months initially and $\\Sexpr{Duration}$ months thereafter.\n  \\item The Average Revenue per Account (ARPA) is therefore initially \\$$\\Sexpr{ARPA}$.\n  \\item The profit margin on every sale is \\$$\\Sexpr{Margin}$.\n  \\item The initial customer base is assumed to be $\\Sexpr{Customers}$.\n  \\item The initial Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is therefore $\\Sexpr{MRR}$.\n  \\item The discount rate is assumed to be $\\Sexpr{(R*100)}$\\%.\n  \\item The initial advertising budget for this firm is assumed to be \\$$\\Sexpr{AdBudget}$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n\\section*{Methodology}\n\nThe SaaS model is affected by two key factors; Customer Churn/Growth and Revenue Churn/Growth. 'Churn' is the notion of loss over time; it is the factor by which a firm's Customer Base or MRR is eroded by customers leaving the firm or downgrading their subscription. Growth refers to the rate at which the firm acquires new Customers and upgraded clients.\n\nFor the purposes of this example, our business has only 1 tier of service, so we cannot see the effects of customers upgrading or downgrading their subscription. In practice, this change is important, as losing 10 customers could mean losing 9 \\$100 accounts and 1 \\$1000 account, or losing 5 \\$100 accounts and 5 \\$1000 accounts, which have different effects on the MRR of a firm. However, for the purposes of this example, we will assume that all customers are equally valuable. \n\nLet us assume that the Churn and Growth variables are randomly generated values that are distributed according to the following means and variations.  \n\n<<echo=FALSE>>=\n\n# Table Creation\nVariationTable <- array(data=(0:0), dim=c(2,2,2))\ncolnames(VariationTable) <- c(\"Mean\",\"SD\")\nrownames(VariationTable) <- c(\"Churn\",\"Growth\")\nCustomerVariationTable <- VariationTable[,,1]\nRevenueVariationTable <- VariationTable[,,2]\n\n# Input\nCustomerVariationTable[\"Churn\",\"Mean\"] <- 0.05  # Customer Churn Mean \nCustomerVariationTable[\"Churn\",\"SD\"] <- 0.05    # Customer Churn Deviation \nCustomerVariationTable[\"Growth\",\"Mean\"] <- 0.05 # Customer Growth Mean \nCustomerVariationTable[\"Growth\",\"SD\"] <- 0.05  # Customer Growth Deviation \n\n# Aesthetic Formatting\n\nCustomerVariationString <- paste(CustomerVariationTable * 100,'%',sep=\" \")\nCVariationTableFramed <- matrix(CustomerVariationString, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)\ncolnames(CVariationTableFramed) <- c(\"Mean\",\"SD\")\nrownames(CVariationTableFramed) <- c(\"Churn\",\"Growth\")\n@\n\n<<echo=F,results=tex>>=\nprint(xtable(CVariationTableFramed, caption='Summary of Customer Variation'))\n@\n\nUsing these randomly generated vectors, we can then analyze how the following functions change over time.\n\n\\subsection*{Functions}\n\n<<echo=F>>=\n# Generator\n# --------------------- \n\n# Initial Vectors \n\nK <- 5 # Number of Simulations\n\nCustomerChurn <- 0 \nCustomerGrowth <- 0 \n\nRevenueChurn <- 0 \nRevenueGrowth <- 0 \n\n\nChurnedCustomers <- 0\nNewCustomers <- 0\nNetCustomers <- 0\n\nChurnedRevenue <- 0\nExpandedRevenue <- 0\nNetChange <- 0\n\nTime <- c(1:Months)\nCustomerLifetime <- 1/mean(CustomerChurn)\n\nLTV <- (ARPA[1] * Margin * CustomerLifetime)/((1+R/(CustomerLifetime))^(CustomerLifetime))\nCAC <- AdBudget/(ARPA[1] * Margin) \nRecoverCAC <- 0\n\nSimulationSamples <- array(0:0, dim = c(12,13,K))\n\nfor (j in 1:K) {\n  for (i in 1:Months) {\n    # Customer Churn and Growth \n    \n    CustomerChurn <- rnorm(1:Months, mean = CustomerVariationTable[\"Churn\",\"Mean\"], sd = CustomerVariationTable[\"Churn\",\"SD\"]) \n    CustomerGrowth <- abs(rnorm(1:Months, mean = CustomerVariationTable[\"Growth\",\"Mean\"], sd = CustomerVariationTable[\"Growth\",\"SD\"]))\n    \n    # Revenue Churn and Growth \n    \n    RevenueChurn <- rnorm(1:Months, mean = 0.00, sd = 0.00)\n    RevenueGrowth <- abs(rnorm(1:Months, mean = 0.00, sd = 0.00))\n    \n    # Customers\n    ChurnedCustomers[i] <- Customers[i]*CustomerChurn[i]\n    NewCustomers[i] <- Customers[i]*CustomerGrowth[i]\n    NetCustomers[i] <- -ChurnedCustomers[i] + NewCustomers[i]\n    Customers[i+1] <- Customers[i] + NetCustomers[i]\n    \n    # MRR\n    MRR[i] <- Subscription[i] * Customers[i]\n    ChurnedRevenue[i] <- RevenueChurn[i] * Subscription[i]\n    ExpandedRevenue[i] <- RevenueGrowth[i] * Subscription[i]\n    NetChange[i] <- -ChurnedRevenue[i] + ExpandedRevenue[i]\n    Subscription[i + 1] <- Subscription[i] + NetChange[i]\n    \n    # ARPA\n    ARPA[i+1] <- ((Subscription[i] * Customers[i]) + (Subscription[i] * NetCustomers[i]))/(Customers[i+1])\n  \n    # LTV\n    CustomerLifetime <- 1/mean(CustomerChurn)\n    LTV[i] <- (ARPA[i] * Margin * CustomerLifetime)/((1+R/(CustomerLifetime))^(CustomerLifetime))\n    \n    # CAC\n    CAC[1:12] <- AdBudget/mean(NewCustomers)\n    LTVCAC <- LTV[1:12]/CAC[1:12]\n    RecoverCAC[i] <- CAC[i]/(mean(ARPA) * Margin)\n  }\n\nSimulationSamples[,,j] <- matrix(data = c((CustomerChurn[1:12]*100), (CustomerGrowth[1:12]*100),Customers[1:12], ChurnedCustomers[1:12], NewCustomers[1:12], NetCustomers[1:12], Subscription[1:12], MRR[1:12], ARPA[1:12], LTV[1:12], CAC[1:12], RecoverCAC[1:12], LTVCAC[1:12]), nrow=Months)\n}\n\n\n                      \nSimulationMean <- apply(SimulationSamples, c(1,2), mean)\n\nSimulationData <- data.frame(data =  SimulationMean, row.names = c(\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\", \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\"))\nnames(SimulationData) <- c(\"Customer Churn\", \"Customer Growth\",\"Customers\", \"Churned Customers\", \"New Customers\", \"Net Customer Change\", \"Subscription\", \"MRR\", \"ARPA\", \"LTV\", \"CAC\", \"Recover CAC\" , \"LTV/CAC\")\n\nwrite.csv(SimulationData, file=\"SimulationData.Current.csv\")\nwrite.csv(SimulationSamples, file=\"SimulationSamples.Current.csv\")\n@\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Customers}\n\nThe Customers ($C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n$) are the first key component of any SaaS business. It changes as a result of New Customers acquired over time ($NC_1, NC_2, \\ldots, NC_n$) and Churned Customers over time ($CC_1, CC_2, \\ldots, CC_n$). Therefore, it can be related ot the churn and growth factor in the following way:\n\n\\begin{center}\n$C_{i+1} = C_{i} + NC_{i+1} - CC_{i+1}$\n\n$C_{i+1} = C_{i}(1 + g_{i} - c_{i})$\n\\end{center}\n\n\\subsubsection*{MRR}\n\nThe MRR ($MRR_1, MRR_2, \\ldots, MRR_n$) is the second key measure of a SaaS business. It changes as a function of customers and the monthly subscription rate ($S_{i}$), here \\$$\\Sexpr{MRR}$:\n\n\\begin{center}\n$MRR_{i+1} = C_{i+1} \\cdot S_{i+1}$\n\\end{center}\n\n\\subsubsection*{ARPA}\n\nThe ARPA ($ARPA_1, ARPA_2, \\ldots, ARPA_n$) is a function of the MRR and Customers, and measures what the average revenue for each account acquired during the period is. It changes as a function of customers and the monthly subscription rate ($S_{i}$):\n\n\\begin{center}\n$ARPA_{i+1} = \\frac{(C_{i} \\cdot S_{i}) + ((NC_{i+1} - CC_{i+1}) \\cdot S_{i+1})}{C_{i+1}}$\n\\end{center}\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{LTV}\n\nThe LTV ($LTV_1, LTV_2, \\ldots, LTV_n$) is the Lifetime Value of a Customer, and determines how much the 'lifetime' cash flow of a Customer acquired in any period $i$  is. Here, the Customer lifetime can be calculated by realizing that the Churn factor $c_{i}$ represents the monthly rate at which a specific monthly cohort exhausts itself. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{c_{i}}$ is the amount of months it takes for a Cohort to exhaust itself, and similarly, the number of periods we need to discount this cashflow by. \n\nFor the sake of accuracy, we also apply the Profit Margin ($PM_{i}$), here $\\Sexpr{Margin}$\\%, and to the ARPA in order to account for profitable lifetime exclusively:\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n$LTV_{i} = \\frac{ARPA_{i} \\cdot PM_{i} \\cdot \\frac{1}{c_{i}}}{(1 + (r \\cdot \\frac{1}{c_{i}}))^(\\frac{1}{c_{i}}}$\n\n\\end{center}\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{CAC}\n\nThe CAC ($CAC_1, CAC_2, \\ldots, CAC_n$) is the Cost to Acquire a Customer, and determines how much the cost to acquire each customer was in any period $i$  is. It is a function of the Advertising Budget ($AB_{i}$), here \\$$\\Sexpr{AdBudget}$, and the number of Customers $C_{i}$. \n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n$CAC_{i} = \\frac{AB_{i}}{C_{i}}$\n\n\\end{center}\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{CAC Recovery}\n\nThe CAC Recovery ($CACr_1, CACr_2, \\ldots, CACr_n$) is the Months taken to recover the CAC, and determines how long it takes to recover the cost to acquire each customer was in any period $i$  is. It is a function of the Cost to Acquire a Customer ($CAC_{i}$), the monthly subscription rate ($S_{i}$), here \\$$\\Sexpr{Subscription}$, and the Profit Margin ($PM_{i}$), here $\\Sexpr{Margin}$\\%:\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n$CACr_{i} = \\frac{CAC_{i}}{S_{i} \\cdot PM_{i}}$\n\n\\end{center}\n\n\\subsubsection*{LTV/CAC}\n\nThe LTV/CAC ($\\frac{LTV}{CAC}_1, \\frac{LTV}{CAC}_2, \\ldots, \\frac{LTV}{CAC}_n$) is the ratio of the LTV to the CAC, and determines how much a customer is worth over his entire lifetime in terms of the cost taken to acquire him in any period $i$  is. It is a function of the LTV ($LTV_{i}$), and the CAC ($CAC_{i}$):\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n$\\frac{LTV}{CAC} = \\frac{LTV_{i}}{CAC_{i}}$\n\n\\end{center}\n\n\\subsection*{Applications}\n\nTherefore, using these functions, our expected Customer Churn, and our expected Customer Growth, it is possible to simulate a variety of randomly generated cases \n\n\n<<echo=F,results=tex>>=\n\nprint(xtable(SimulationData[,3:6] , caption = 'Customer Projections', label='tab:1'), display='d', tabular.environment=\"tabularx\", width=\"\\\\textwidth\")\nprint(xtable(SimulationData[,7:13] , caption = 'MRR Projections', label='tab:2'), display='d', tabular.environment=\"tabularx\", width=\"\\\\textwidth\")\n\n@\n\n\\subsection*{MRR Tables}\n\n\n<<echo=FALSE>>=\n# Cohort Tables\n\n\n# Customers\nCustomerMatrix <- matrix(0:0,nrow=Months,ncol=Months)\nMRRMatrix <- matrix(0:0,nrow=Months,ncol=(Months))\ncolnames(CustomerMatrix) <- c(\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\", \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\")\ncolnames(MRRMatrix) <- c(\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\", \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\")\n\nMRRMatrix[1,1] <- SimulationData[1,'Customers'] * SimulationData[1,'Subscription']\nCustomerMatrix[1,1] <- SimulationData[1,'Customers']\n\n\nfor (i in 1:(Months-1)) {\n  CustomerMatrix[i + 1, i + 1] <- NewCustomers[i+1]\n  CustomerMatrix[,i+1] <- CustomerMatrix[,i] * (1 - CustomerChurn[i])\n  CustomerMatrix[i + 1, i + 1] <- NewCustomers[i+1]\n  MRRMatrix[,i + 1] <- CustomerMatrix[,i + 1] * Subscription[i]\n}\n@\n\n<<echo=F,results=tex>>=\nprint(xtable(round(CustomerMatrix), tabular.enviroment='tabularx', caption = 'Customer Cohort Table', label='tabc'), floating.environment='sidewaystable', scalebox=0.9)\n\nprint(xtable(round(MRRMatrix), tabular.enviroment='tabularx', caption = 'MRR Cohort Table', label='tabm'), floating.environment='sidewaystable', scalebox=0.9)\n\n@\n\n\nCross-references to tables \\ref{tabc} and \\ref{tabm}.\n\nMethodology \nGenerate Data\nTables\nGraphs\nTaught myself in R\nRefence Sources\n \n\nDiscussions \n1) Customers\nFunctions\nCode\n2) Churn\n\nResults / Analysis \nTables \nPlots Facet wrap\nSavings\n\nShow comparisions via changing of parameters\nGood Case\nNeutral Case\nBad Case\n\n\nConclusion (Explain Results)\nSavings\nPros/Cons\nMove forward\nAdvantages of this method (Predictive analysis given a few input variables)\ncan be extnded over time\n\n\n\\end{document}",
