# [12 steps toward rock-solid scientific Python code](http://www.davidketcheson.info/2015/05/10/rock_solid_code.html)

## by David Kitchenson

A series of scripts followed a blog series I stumbled upon that goes through some really useful steps in maintaing good Scientific Python code. This blog series should allow you to:

* Have confidence in your computed results
* Accelerate your research
* Better communicate your research
* Collaborate more effectively
* Help others build on your work

Much of this code will retrofit the blog post into testable scripts, and intends to follow along with the [example repo](https://github.com/ketch/rock-solid-code-demo) he has also provided. It will be updated as the series continues.

His 12 steps, are as follows:
* Use version control
* Put your code in the cloud, in the open (:octocat:!)
* Add a README and a License
* Write docstrings
* Write tests
* Keep track of issues
* Automate the tests
* Automate the build (coming soon)
* Use continuous integration (coming soon)
* Monitor test coverage (coming soon)
* Write narrative documentation (coming soon)
* Catch errors as you type them (coming soon)

Or, to categorize another way:

|   Stage  | Steps | Description                |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Automation  | 1, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 10, 12 | Removal of manual processes makes code more reliable.    
| Documentation |      3, 4, 5, 6, 11     | Writing and thinking about the code makes it more reliable.          |
| Communication |   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11  | Code that is read and used by more than one person is more reliable. |
